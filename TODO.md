# TODO: Update Room Booking System to Use Real Database Data

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### 1. Created API Layer for Rooms
- Created `src/api/rooms.js` with functions to fetch rooms from backend API
- Functions: `getAllRooms()`, `getRoomById()`, `createRoom()`, `updateRoom()`, `deleteRoom()`

### 2. Updated User Components to Use Real Data
- **DaftarRuangan.jsx**: Replaced hardcoded `roomsData` with API call to `getAllRooms()`
  - Added loading and error states
  - Fetches real rooms from database on component mount
- **FormPeminjaman.jsx**: Replaced hardcoded `room` array with API call to `getAllRooms()`
  - Room dropdown now shows real rooms from database
  - Added loading state for room selection

### 3. Updated Admin Components to Use Real Data
- **RoomsAdmin.jsx**: Replaced hardcoded `roomsData` with API call to `getAllRooms()`
  - Added loading and error states
  - Fetches real rooms from database on component mount

### 4. Verified Existing Real Data Usage
- **RiwayatPeminjaman.jsx**: Already using `useBookings()` hook with real data ‚úÖ
- **DetailRoomUser.jsx**: Already using `useBookings()` hook with real data ‚úÖ
- **Dashboard.jsx**: Already using `useBookings()` hook with real data ‚úÖ
- **DashboardAdmin.jsx**: Already using `useBookings()` hook with real data ‚úÖ
- **RiwayatAdmin.jsx**: Already using `useBookings()` hook with real data ‚úÖ
- **BookingsAdmin.jsx**: Already using `useBookings()` hook with real data ‚úÖ

## Key Changes Made

1. **Room Data**: All hardcoded room arrays replaced with API calls to fetch from database
2. **Booking Data**: All components already using real booking data via `useBookings()` hook
3. **Synchronization**: User and admin views now show consistent data from the same database
4. **No localStorage**: Eliminated localStorage usage for booking data (authentication still uses localStorage)

## Testing Required üîç

- [ ] Test user login and room booking flow
- [ ] Verify room list displays real rooms from database
- [ ] Check booking form shows real rooms in dropdown
- [ ] Confirm admin can view and manage all bookings
- [ ] Test synchronization between user and admin views
- [ ] Verify booking status updates reflect in all views

## Backend Dependencies

- Backend routes for bookings and rooms are already implemented
- Database models (Booking.js, Room.js) are properly defined
- Authentication middleware is in place

## Notes

- All booking data was already being fetched from database via API calls
- The main issue was hardcoded room data in some components
- Form submission already saves to database correctly
- Admin booking management already updates database
